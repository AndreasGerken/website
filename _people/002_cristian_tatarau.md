PostDoc, working on the project "Learning the language of the brain: adaptive brain-machine interfaces maximize information transfer through autonomous interaction with brain tissue". I'm working at the boundary between Life Sciences and Computer Science. I'm passionate about understanding how neural systems work, about what we can learn from nature, and how we can apply artificial intelligence to clinical applications.

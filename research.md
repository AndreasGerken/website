Everything is connected. The nature of the world is much like a dense network of connected nodes, whether it may be molecules that interact, humans that communicate or weather systems that influence each other. 

The Landgraf lab studies complex <i>social</i> systems - collectives made of individual living units that each observe their environment, learn whatâ€™s good and bad, and interact with conspecifics. These interactions (and how they change over time) often create emergent properties on the group level: from coordinated motion patterns of flocks and shoals to the democratic decision making process in humans. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts - but exactly <i>how</i>?

<h1>Research Dimension 1: Models of Individual Behavior</h1>
To understand how collectives can be smart and how group patterns emerge, we often simplify the system, creating models that represent how we <i>think</i> each individual works: Does it have a memory of past events? How is an observation of the environment translated to behavior? Rather than using the human brain to come up with a model, a part of the Landgraf lab is concerned with (machine) learning models of individual behavior. How can we leverage large amounts of data to extract a model that not only is as accurate but also as generic as possible? How can we control the level of abstraction and how can we make sure we humans learn something about the actual living system and not just about our model?
